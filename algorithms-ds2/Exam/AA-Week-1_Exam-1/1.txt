1. What is the shortest path problem? Give a real world shortest path problem. Formulate it in most general form so that the solution can be independent of its application.  (1+1+3=5M)

sol: 

If there are a set of nodes with some inter-connections between them. If we need to travel from one node to another node, in shortest time, then we need to find the shortest path available between the nodes.
examples :
1) suppose there is a pizza delivery person, who needs to deliver 5 pizzas within one hour of time,
	In this scenario the person will first try finding the shortest path such that he will traverse all the places and within the specified time.
2) consider a logistic company needs to deliver the goods to their customers who are in different places, then they need to search for the shortest path so as to gain the profit.
3)shortest path problem can be applied to technical issues like delivering the packet from in a network which has many routers or switches.
If we apply the algorithms then, we will get a clear idea about how to deliver a packet within less time. Network table will work based on these algorithms


Consider the google maps, if we are in a location A and are searching for a way to go to location B. Then we will get the possible ways like
a)By walk
b) By car
c) By Bus
these are like the intermediate nodes. If we apply the shortest path algotihms available,then we will know how much time it will take to travel to another location following the intermediate nodes.
