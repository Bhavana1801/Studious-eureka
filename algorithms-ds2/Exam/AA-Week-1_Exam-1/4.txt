4. State advantages and disadvantages of Dijkstra’s algorithm over the Bellman-Ford Algorithm (2M)


advantages :
 1)Time complexity is less when compared to Bellman-Ford
Dijkstras - O(m+nlogn) 
Bellaman-ford O(mn)
2) Can relate to real world applications mostly like network routing, maps.


disadvantages :
 1) It cannot be applied to negatice costs.
 2) It cannot be applied to a cyclic graph
while Bellman-ford can be applied.
